A fully interactive Power BI dashboard that visually explores the legendary cricket career of Virat Kohli — showcasing his match formats, runs, averages, boundaries, and performance across years, months, and opponents.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project started as a simple idea: to analyze the career statistics of Virat Kohli. The raw data was initially messy, inconsistent, and difficult to structure. I performed all the data cleaning in Excel, correcting formats, filling gaps, and preparing it for analysis. The entire dashboard, visuals, filters, and storytelling was done using Power BI — from scratch, using my own creativity.

The result is an engaging and professional visual story of one of cricket’s greatest batsmen.

## 💡 My Journey & Experience

When I began this project, I faced many data cleaning issues that left me confused and stuck. But with consistent effort and help from GPT (ChatGPT), I was able to understand the problems, fix the errors, and prepare clean, structured data. From there, I built the complete dashboard using Power BI, designing every visual element myself without using templates.

This dashboard is more than just a report — it’s a product of learning, problem-solving, and creativity.
